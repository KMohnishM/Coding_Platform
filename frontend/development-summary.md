# Frontend Development Summary

## Completed Work

We have successfully created a complete LeetCode-like frontend with hint functionality. The frontend features include:

### Core Components

1. **User Interface**
   - Modern, clean design with responsive layout
   - Navbar with authentication status
   - Tabbed mobile navigation for smaller screens
   - Professional styling similar to LeetCode

2. **Authentication**
   - Sign-in component with email and username fields
   - User state management via localStorage
   - Sign-out functionality

3. **Problem Listing**
   - Sortable and filterable problem list
   - Topic filtering with dropdown
   - Difficulty level filtering with visual indicators
   - Search functionality for problem titles

4. **Problem Solving Interface**
   - Split-panel layout (problem on left, code editor on right)
   - Monaco code editor integration for professional coding experience
   - Multiple programming language support
   - Run and Submit buttons
   - Detailed test results display

5. **Hint System**
   - Visually appealing hint display panel
   - Request hint button
   - Progressive hint levels with visual indicators
   - Timestamp display for hints

6. **Mock Data & Services**
   - Mock problem dataset
   - Mock code runner with test execution simulation
   - Mock hint generation system

### Technical Implementation

1. **React Components**
   - AppFull.jsx - Main application shell with routing and layout
   - ProblemListFull.jsx - Enhanced problem listing with filtering
   - ProblemDetailFull.jsx - Code editor and problem display
   - MonacoEditor.jsx - Professional code editor integration
   - HintsPanel.jsx - Hint display and request UI
   - SignIn.jsx - Authentication form
   - Navbar.jsx - Navigation header
   - TopicFilter.jsx - Filtering component

2. **Styling**
   - Modern CSS with consistent color scheme
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
   - Visual indicators for test results and hint levels

3. **Mock Services**
   - mockRunner.js for code execution simulation
   - problems.js with test data

## Backend API Requirements

We've identified the following backend endpoints required for the frontend:

### Currently Implemented
- `POST /api/hints/request_hint/` - Request a hint for a problem
- `POST /api/hints/check_auto_trigger/` - Check if a hint should be auto-triggered
- `POST /api/hints/{hint_delivery_id}/provide_feedback/` - Provide feedback on a hint

### Missing (Need Implementation)
- **Authentication Endpoints** - User registration, login, and logout
- **Problems Endpoints** - List, filter, and retrieve problem details
- **Submission Endpoints** - Submit and evaluate code
- **Topics Endpoint** - Get available topics for filtering

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Development**
   - Implement the missing API endpoints
   - Add authentication system
   - Create problem management functionality
   - Implement code submission and evaluation system

2. **Integration**
   - Replace mock services with real API calls
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add loading states for API interactions

3. **Additional Features**
   - User profile page
   - Progress tracking
   - Problem completion statistics
   - Code history/versioning

4. **Deployment**
   - Set up production build
   - Configure deployment pipeline
   - Implement environment-specific configurations

The frontend is now fully functional with mock data and provides a complete user experience similar to LeetCode with the added hint functionality. The next major phase will be connecting it to a fully-featured backend API.
